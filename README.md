# Bloodpoint Farming Macros!
Here you can find macros that will help with the repetitive/tedious aspects of farming bloodpoints in Dead by Daylight!

**NOTES:**
- All .ahk files require [Auto Hotkey v1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe).
- You can easily edit each macro to optimise them for non-standard configurations using notepad.
- The FPS switching macro uses a pure white pixel (in the text on the pause screen) so may not be compatible with certain shader/filter settings. We recommend that you turn off any shaders or filters and make sure that your UI scale is set to 100% when using the macro.

# Auto Click
- Auto-clicker for spending bloodpoints.
- F6 = Toggle ON / F7 = Toggle OFF

# Killer Shuffle
- Killer will repeatedly move forwards and backwards to allow survivors to easily get in chase (Spin blinding, Gen dancing, etc).
- F8 = Toggle ON / F9 = Toggle OFF

# FPS Switch
- Very quickly switches between 30 & 120 FPS.
- F3 = Set 30 FPS / F4 = Set 120 FPS

# FPS Switch (sleep)
- Slowly switches between 30 & 120 FPS.
- F3 = Set 30 FPS / F4 = Set 120 FPS
- **NOTE:** This version of the FPS Switch macro can potentially work better for non-standard configurations (shaders, filters, etc).
