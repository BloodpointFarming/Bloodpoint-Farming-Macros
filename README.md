# Bloodpoint-Farming-Macros
- Here you can find macros that will help when farming bloodpoints in Dead by Daylight!
- All .ahk files require Auto Hotkey v1.1 which can be found [HERE](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe).
- The FPS switching macro uses a white pixel in the text on the pause screen. If you're using shaders, you may need to edit the hex code to match the re-coloured pixel.
