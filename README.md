# Bloodpoint-Farming-Macros
- Here you can find macros that will help when farming bloodpoints in Dead by Daylight!
- All .ahk files require Auto Hotkey v1.1 which can be found [HERE](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe).
- The FPS switching macro uses a pure white pixel (in the text on the pause screen) so may not be compatible with certain shader/filter settings. We recommend that you turn off any shaders or filters when using the macro.
