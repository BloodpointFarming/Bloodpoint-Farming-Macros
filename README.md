# Bloodpoint Farming Macros!
Here you can find macros that will help with the repetitive/tedious aspects of farming bloodpoints in Dead by Daylight!

**NOTES:**
- All .ahk files require [Auto Hotkey v1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe).
- You can easily edit each macro to optimise them with non-standard configurations using notepad.
- The FPS switching macro uses a pure white pixel (in the text on the pause screen) so may not be compatible with certain shader/filter settings. We recommend that you turn off any shaders or filters when using the macro.
